# Brain-Tumor-MRI-ML
Welcome to the Brain Tumor MRI Image Classification repository, a showcase of my expertise in machine learning and computer vision. This repository serves as a part of my portfolio, demonstrating my skills in leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to solve real-world problems in medical image analysis.

## Overview
In the realm of medical diagnostics, the accurate classification of brain tumor MRI images is of paramount importance for timely and effective patient care. Leveraging the power of transfer learning and the robust DenseNet121 architecture, this project showcases my ability to develop a cutting-edge solution for this critical task.

## Key Features
- **Transfer Learning with DenseNet121**: We utilize the pre-trained DenseNet121 model, fine-tuned on a dataset of brain tumor MRI images. Transfer learning allows us to benefit from a pre-trained model's knowledge and adapt it to our specific classification task.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Rigorous data preprocessing techniques ensure that the input images are appropriately prepared for the model. This includes image resizing and augmentation to enhance model generalization.
- **Multi-class Classification**: The model is designed to classify brain tumor MRI images into multiple classes, enabling the differentiation of various tumor types and locations within the brain.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: We employ standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance, ensuring reliable and interpretable results.
- **Visualization**: Visualizations of model predictions provide insights into the model's decision-making process, helping to interpret its predictions.

## Datasets:
- [brain-tumor-mri-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

the dataset splitted into:
- Train (5712 images)
- Test (1311 images)

In the context of brain tumor MRI image classification using transfer learning with DenseNet121, the goal is to categorize MRI scans into four distinct classes or categories. Each category corresponds to a different condition that can be identified from the brain MRI images. Here's an explanation of the four classification categories:
- **Glioma**: Glioma is a type of brain tumor that originates from glial cells, which are supportive cells in the brain. Gliomas can vary in severity and are classified into different grades, with Grade IV gliomas (glioblastomas) being the most aggressive. Detecting gliomas early is crucial for treatment planning and patient outcomes.
- **Meningioma**: Meningiomas are usually non-cancerous tumors that develop from the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Although they are generally slow-growing and benign, they can cause symptoms as they press on adjacent brain structures. Early detection and monitoring are essential for managing meningiomas.
- **No Tumor**: This category is for MRI images that do not exhibit any signs of brain tumors or abnormalities. These images represent cases where no pathological conditions, such as glioma or meningioma, are present. It's important to be able to correctly identify normal brain scans to avoid unnecessary medical interventions.
- **Pituitary**: The pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. Tumors can develop in the pituitary gland, which can lead to hormonal imbalances and various health issues. Early diagnosis and classification of pituitary tumors are crucial for endocrinological and neurological management.

## Usage
This repository is intended for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes. You can explore the code and project documentation to gain insights into how transfer learning with DenseNet121 can be applied to medical image classification tasks. While you can't access patient data due to privacy concerns, you can use your own dataset or publicly available datasets for similar tasks.
